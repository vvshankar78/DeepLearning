## [TinyImageNet](https://github.com/vvshankar78/DeepLearning/tree/master/Extensive%20VisionAI-EVA6/10_Object_Localization/TinyImagenet)

1. Download this [TINY IMAGENET ](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)dataset. 
2. Train ResNet18 on this dataset for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
3. Used LR finder and One cycle policy for learning rates. 



## [CocoDataset Anchor Box using K-means](https://github.com/vvshankar78/DeepLearning/tree/master/Extensive%20VisionAI-EVA6/10_Object_Localization/Coco_Anchor_Box)

1. Download [COCO DATASET ](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip) and understand the schema 
2. class distribution (along with the class names) along with a graph 
3. Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.
