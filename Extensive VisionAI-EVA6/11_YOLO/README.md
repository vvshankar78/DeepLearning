## [OpenCV YOLO](https://github.com/vvshankar78/DeepLearning/tree/master/Extensive%20VisionAI-EVA6/11_YOLO/OpenCV_Yolo)

1. Run this OpenCV Yolo from the [SOURCE](https://pysource.com/2019/06/27/yolo-object-detection-using-opencv-with-python/) on your laptop or Colab. 
2. Take an image of yourself, holding another object which is there in COCO data set (search for COCO classes to learn). 
3. Run this image through the code above. 
4. Upload the annotated image by YOLO. 



## Custom YOLO

- Refer to this Colab File: [LINK](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LbKkQf4hbIuiUHunLlvY-cc0d_sNcAgS)
- Refer to this GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/theschoolofai/YoloV3)
- Download [this dataset (Links to an external site.)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sVSAJgmOhZk6UG7EzmlRjXfkzPxmpmLy/view?usp=sharing). This was annotated by EVA5 Students. Collect and add 25 images for the following 4 classes into the dataset shared:
  1. class names are in custom.names file. 
  2. you must follow exact rules to make sure that you can train the model. Steps are explained in the README.md file on github repo link above.
  3. Once you add your additional 100 images, train the model
